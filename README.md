# Improved-3D-2D-CNN
This is mainly an improved 3D-2D CNN approach where the model network is built with three 3D CNN layers followed by a 2D CNN layer to use the most informative parts of hyperspectral images as spectral and spatial features are analysed and used to classify the hypercubes correctly.
